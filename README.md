MRTG View
========

A better way to view MRTG graphs.


Install
-------

MRTG has to be run with the _'--subdirs=HOSTNAME_SNMPNAME'_ configuration for MRTG View to work.

1. Download MRTG View and extract it to your www root folder.
2. Edit the 'config.php' and change $mrtg_path to reflect where MRTG is storing its graphs.
3. Your donw, point you browser at the MRTG View path.


There is still a lot that needs to be done but it is a good start.
